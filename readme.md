CrowdProcess is a web-based distributed supercomputer. This plugin installs a CrowdProcess "worker" on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

While browsing the web, people waste a lot of processing power on their computers.

[CrowdProcess](http://crowdprocess.com) enables websites to collect tiny amounts of wasted processing power from people's browsers. It then purchase that processing power from websites, turns it into a single supercomputer and makes it available to people who are solving computationally heavy problems such as credit attribution, transport grid optimization or even genome sequencing.
